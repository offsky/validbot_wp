Validate a website to ensure it follows best practices for security, performance and effectiveness.

== Description ==

ValidBot is a website validation tool that combines many different tests into one comprehensive audit.  Make sure that your website is following best practices and is safe, secure, fast and effective. There are over 100 individual tests with plans to add more in the near future. Test your domain registration, DNS records, SSL, lighthouse tests, server response headers, meta tags, email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), Favicons, robots.txt file and more. 

ValidBot can proactively monitor your website and notify you if any of our tests start failing. If your domain name or SSL are about to expire, we'll let you know before it's too late. If your site starts loading slowly or if a DNS record gets misconfigured, you can get notified.
